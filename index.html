   		<td>[Piece 1: My social justice is about recycling and I chose this topic because recycling is important to the environment and it's bad if people don't recycle. If you don't recycle it can reduce air and water pollution which affects our community in a horrible way. The way I assembled my photos is by taking recycling signs and trying to mix them in where there is trash not being recycled and my creative process was when I took the recycling sign and mixed it with the person recycling.</td>
   		<td>[Piece 2: I used the pencil tool and erase tool to draw my chicken and erase my mistakes. I started bylooking for ideas to do and just decided to do a chicken and stuck with it. My character looks like a chicken but a house. My character is not wearing clothes because it is a house. My character in this game would be a chicken house that people live in. the purpose of this game would be to start a farm and grow plants.</td>
   		<td>[Piece 3: I copied an image from google and placed it into my pr and i had to change the background colors on the image and i tried to style it with my own design.For me to change the way it looks, i had to add extra layers to it so the background colors can show more.</td>
